# Airbnb Clone Project Overview

This project is an **Airbnb Clone**, designed to replicate core features of the popular vacation rental platform. The goal of this project is to provide a hands-on learning experience in full-stack web development while showcasing the ability to design, build, and deploy a modern, production-ready web application.  

The primary objectives of the project are:  
- **User Experience:** Provide an intuitive interface where users can create accounts, browse available listings, book stays, and manage reservations.  
- **Host Features:** Allow hosts to list properties, upload details, set availability, and manage bookings.  
- **Scalability:** Build a system capable of supporting multiple users, listings, and interactions in a performant way.  
- **Real-World Practices:** Apply industry-standard techniques such as authentication, relational databases, and cloud deployment.  

This project demonstrates how a complex system like Airbnb can be broken down into smaller, manageable components, developed, and integrated into a functional product.

## Tech Stack

The Airbnb Clone is built using a modern full-stack approach:

- **Backend:** [Python Django] – handling authentication, booking logic, and property management.  
- **Frontend:** [HTML, CSS, JavaScript] – delivering responsive, user-friendly interfaces for both guests and hosts.  
- **Database:** [MariaDB / PostgreSQL] – managing structured data for users, listings, reservations, and reviews.  
- **Version Control:** [Git & GitHub] – enabling collaboration, branching, and tracking project evolution.  
- **Cloud & Deployment:** [AWS (EC2, S3, RDS)] – hosting the application, managing static files, and ensuring availability.  
- **Developer Tools:** [Visual Studio Code, Git Bash, Docker (optional)] – streamlining the development process.

## Conclusion

This **Airbnb Clone** is more than a coding exercise; it is a demonstration of full-cycle development — from backend logic and database design to frontend interactivity and cloud deployment. By mirroring real-world product features, the project highlights skills in software engineering, problem-solving, and delivering scalable web applications.

Do you want me to also include a **“Features” section** (like Authentication, Search, Reviews, Booking Flow) so the README looks more like a real product repo?
